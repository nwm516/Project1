# Project1's Background

This was the big project for my Component Software Development class at North Seattle College. This was a project developed in Java.

This was Project1's objective: "Kaggle has provided us with a list of the most popularly streamed song in 2023. Our goal is to create a GUI that allows the selection of a release year, then buttons that allow the user to browse through the songs from that year that are popular in 2023. We look at the data and decide to use a two-dimensional array to store the song data, plus a parallel single-dimensional array for release years."
